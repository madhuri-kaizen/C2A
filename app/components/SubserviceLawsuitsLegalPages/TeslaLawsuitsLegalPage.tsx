According to regulators, the software allowed misuse, including driving without proper supervision, increasing crash risks. This recall affected millions of vehicles and added to a growing list of safety-related actions, including the Tesla power steering recall, Tesla Cybertruck recall, and other high-profile Tesla recalls.",
